# What Even Is This
An assignment for Linguistics asked me to go through a dozen Shakesperean sonnets and write all the sentence-final rhymes that belonged in a word bank. Which I really didn't want to do.

Making this code took probably more time that actually doing the assignment but it was much more fun.
